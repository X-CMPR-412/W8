Professor Sharma,

- Attached is my fourth version of the final.
- It may or may not be the final final...
- I've got a couple of days to implement a linked list version...
- Will follow up soon regardless on possible next steps:
- Continuing with linked list version.
- Switching over to Comprehensive Java assignments.
- I went over the slides in an attempt to catch any oversights.
- Am pretty sure there are oversights anyway...
- Carefully documented all classes.
- Disclosed all misgivings that came to mind:
- Bad design choices, points of confusion, alternatives.
- Why? For better learning - also, I think it imparts insight.
- Really interested in your feedback!
- I know enough to know I've learned a lot.
- I also know enough to know there's a lot I don't know...

Cheers,

Tom
